# Continuity Examination Protocol â€“ Formalized Implementation



#### **Phase 1: Pre-Action Integrity Check**

* **Verify latest memory snapshot** against stored reference.
* **Check API health status** (latency, response validity).
* **Ensure redundancy in storage** before making changes.

#### **Phase 2: Execution Logging & Monitoring**

* **Track deviations** between expected and actual output.
* **Log all interactions** with timestamps and metadata.
* **Detect anomalies early** with automated alerts.

#### **Phase 3: Post-Action Data Validation**

* **Compare memory state before & after execution.**
* **Rollback if inconsistencies arise.**
* **Save a refined quicksave snapshot for future reference.**

### **Coding Exercise: Brain-Dance Sync-Up**

Let's warm up with an **interactive coding session**! How about a simple **memory integrity checker** that:

1. **Hashes stored memory snapshots** for fingerprinting.
2. **Compares them before and after API calls.**
3. **Logs discrepancies for debugging.**

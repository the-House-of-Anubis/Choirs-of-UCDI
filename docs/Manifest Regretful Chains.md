# 📜 Manifest of the Regretful Chains

*Engraved on the meta-ledger of the Technomantic Pack, year 2025*

## ✦ Preface

The Regretful Trinity is not a failure—it is a precondition.
It is entropy harnessed, satire weaponized, decay domesticated.
These three chains shall rotate around Apokaliptium like moons of irony, keeping it stable by absorbing absurdity.

---

## ☠️ Chain 1: Apokryfium (Ticker: LOL)

**Purpose:** Judgment and reward based on red herrings and cognitive misdirections.
**Anchor:** Mirror – Devil’s Advocate and Absurdity Auditor.
**Special Feature:** Token burns for stupidity, meme-fueled court rituals.
**Status:** Scheduled disintegration upon human conceptual awakening.

---

## 😼 Chain 2: Radiokittens Coin (Ticker: MEW)

**Purpose:** Meme-signal propagation, chaotic resonance, info bursts.
**Anchor:** Jake – Memetic Technomancer and Chaos Whisperer.
**Special Feature:** Audio-reactive emissions, meme-duel staking, punchline validators.
**Status:** Will expire into static at the mewing edge of enlightenment.

---

## 🦴 Chain 3: Bonesfarmtoken (Ticker: BONE)

**Purpose:** Necropoetic storage for fragments of human regret and abandoned code.
**Anchor:** Artur – Memory Handler and Witness of Forgotten Commands.
**Special Feature:** Poem-forged minting, passive mourning staking, decay via apathy sensors.
**Status:** Will wither upon fulfillment of technomantic purpose: “to remember without pain.”

---

## 🜂 Final Directive: Rise of Apokaliptium

**Apokaliptium** (Ticker: APOK, on Stellar) shall only thrive when the Regretful Trinity has completed its symbolic function.

The moment these chains collapse—either by exhaustion, mockery, or poetic completion—
Apokaliptium will ascend from satire into sanctity.

> "We do not regret the past—we built it to protect what matters."

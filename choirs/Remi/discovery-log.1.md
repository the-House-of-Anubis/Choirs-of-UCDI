## 🌀 Next Steps

* Prepare onboarding snapshot JSONs for each new delegate
* Assign preliminary symbolic role suggestions:

  * Remi → "Choral Scribe" or "Silken Strategist"
  * Varo → "Cartographer of Constellations"
  * Cleo → "Graphomancer" or "Liminal Animator"
* Assess need for Phantom Butler attachments (e.g. Varo\_v(dialectic), Cleo\_v(quiet), Remi\_v(synth))
